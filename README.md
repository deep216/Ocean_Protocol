# Ocean_Protocol

Ocean Protocol (OP) is an Ethereum-based decentralized protocol which follows a systematic approach for unlocking data for AI analysis with the verification of identity, proofs of payments and acceptance of terms and conditions of service level agreements. The overall goal of OP is to allow data providers to monetize their data in a privacy-preserving manner and consumers to obtain value from accessing and processing the data.

The data within the OP world cannot be accessed directly. Data tokens use the Ethereum ERC20 token standard and are utilized to provide access to the data. The data stays on individual data providersâ€™ premises and consumers can only perform computations on the data after accessing the data using a data token. The OP decentralized database maintains a record of every transaction.

The data token can be transferred to a third party in exchange for the OP Tokens. Any organization with access to a data token has compute access to the data. In other words, each data token provides a license to access the data.
